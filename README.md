I am an experienced software developer with extensive expertise in professional software development across various industries. My skills include the latest development tools, frameworks, and database systems, as well as the Azure Cloud. I have gained many years of experience both as a freelancer and in permanent positions.

Since August 2022, I have been working as a software developer at [wibutler](https://dbt-platform.com/), where I closely collaborate with international colleagues on the [wibutler IoT platform](https://wibutler-iot.com/) for digital building technology.

I hold a Microsoft certification in [Azure IoT](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/solutions/iot) development, which highlights my skills and knowledge in designing, implementing, and maintaining IoT solutions using [Azure services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products). 

My goal is to develop innovative solutions and contribute to the advancement of technology.
